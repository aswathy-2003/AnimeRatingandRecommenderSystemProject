# Anime Rating Analysis and Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyses anime user rating data from MyAnimeList and develops 
a machine learning–based recommender system. The dataset includes 
ratings from over 73,000 users across more than 12,000 anime titles, along 
with anime metadata such as genre, type, popularity, and average ratings. 
Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis are performed using 
Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to understand user behaviour and rating 
patterns. 
Regression and classification models are applied to predict user ratings and 
classify anime preferences. A collaborative filtering–based recommender 
system using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm generates personalized 
anime recommendations based on user similarity. The project 
demonstrates practical applications of machine learning in content 
personalization and recommendation systems. A simple Gradio-based 
interface was integrated to allow users to search anime titles and view rating 
insights, making the system interactive and user-friendly.
